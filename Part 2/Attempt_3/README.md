# Arena RL - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Action Arena Games

A real-time Pygame arena game environment with deep reinforcement learning agents trained using Stable Baselines3. This project implements a complete RL pipeline including custom Gym environments, training scripts, and evaluation tools.

## Game Overview

The arena is a simplified action game where:
- **Player Ship**: A controllable ship with health, movement, and shooting capabilities
- **Enemy Spawners**: Hexagonal structures that periodically spawn enemies
- **Enemies**: Red diamond-shaped entities that chase the player
- **Projectiles**: Player-fired bullets that damage enemies and spawners
- **Phase System**: Destroying all spawners progresses to harder phases

### Objective
Survive as long as possible while destroying enemy spawners to progress through phases. The game features continuous movement, collision detection, and a phase-based difficulty system.

## Control Schemes

### Control Style 1: Rotation Movement
| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 0 | No action |
| 1 | Thrust forward |
| 2 | Rotate left |
| 3 | Rotate right |
| 4 | Shoot |
| 5 | Thrust + Shoot (combined) |
| 6 | Rotate left + Shoot (combined) |
| 7 | Rotate right + Shoot (combined) |

The ship has momentum and friction, requiring the player to plan ahead. Combined actions allow shooting while moving, making the control scheme more viable for combat.

### Control Style 2: Directional Movement
| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 0 | No action |
| 1 | Move up |
| 2 | Move down |
| 3 | Move left |
| 4 | Move right |
| 5 | Shoot (auto-aims at nearest target) |

Direct 4-way movement with auto-aiming when shooting. Easier to learn but less precise control.

## Observation Space

### Rotation Controls (28 features)
| Index | Feature | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 0-1 | Player position | x, y normalized to [-1, 1] |
| 2-3 | Player velocity | vx, vy normalized |
| 4-5 | Player orientation | cos(angle), sin(angle) |
| 6 | Player health | Normalized [0, 1] |
| 7 | Current phase | Normalized [0, 1] |
| 8-11 | Nearest enemy | distance, angle, rel_x, rel_y |
| 12-15 | Second nearest enemy | distance, angle, rel_x, rel_y |
| 16-19 | Nearest spawner | distance, angle, rel_x, rel_y |
| 20-23 | Second nearest spawner | distance, angle, rel_x, rel_y |
| 24 | Enemy count | Normalized count |
| 25 | Spawner count | Normalized count |
| 26 | Can shoot | 1.0 if cooldown ready |
| 27 | Time remaining | Normalized remaining steps |

### Directional Controls (26 features)
Same structure but without orientation features (indices 4-5), as direction is determined by movement.

## Reward Structure

| Event | Reward | Justification |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Kill enemy | +10.0 | Encourages combat engagement |
| Kill spawner | +50.0 | Primary objective - eliminates threat source |
| Progress to next phase | +100.0 | Major milestone reward |
| Take damage | -5.0 | Discourages reckless behavior |
| Death | -200.0 | Strong penalty to encourage survival |
| Survival bonus | +0.1/step | Small reward for staying alive |
| Step penalty | -0.001/step | Encourages efficiency |
| Projectile hit | +2.0 | Rewards accurate shooting |

### Shaping Rewards (Justified)

**Rotation Controls** (enhanced shaping for harder control scheme):
- **Facing spawner bonus**: Up to +0.03/step when facing toward nearest spawner
  - *Justification*: Rotation requires learning to aim; this guides aiming behavior
- **Approach spawner bonus**: Up to +0.02/step when close to spawners
  - *Justification*: Guides exploration toward main objectives
- **Facing enemy bonus**: Up to +0.01/step when facing nearby enemies (<200 distance)
  - *Justification*: Encourages defensive awareness and combat readiness
- **Surrounded penalty**: -0.01/step per enemy beyond 3 within 150 distance
  - *Justification*: Discourages getting surrounded, encourages clearing enemies

**Directional Controls** (simpler shaping):
- **Approach spawner bonus**: Up to +0.02/step when close to spawners
  - *Justification*: Guides early exploration toward main objectives

- **Effects**: Particle explosions on kills and damage

### HUD Information
- Phase counter
- Health bar
- Enemy count
- Spawner count
- Kill statistics
- Reward tracker
- Step counter

## Episode Termination

An episode ends when:
1. **Player Death**: Health reaches 0
2. **Max Steps**: 3000 steps (configurable)
3. **Victory**: All spawners destroyed in final phase (Phase 5)

## Configuration

All game parameters can be adjusted in `config.py`:

### Window Settings
```python
WINDOW_WIDTH = 960
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 680
FPS = 60
```

### Player Settings
```python
PLAYER_MAX_HEALTH = 100
PLAYER_MAX_SPEED = 5.0
PLAYER_SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 10
```

### Difficulty Settings
```python
INITIAL_SPAWNERS = 2
SPAWNERS_PER_PHASE = 1
MAX_PHASE = 5
```

## Expected Performance

After ~500k timesteps of training:
- **Phase Reached**: Consistently reach Phase 2-3
- **Enemies Killed**: 20-50 per episode
- **Spawners Killed**: 2-5 per episode
- **Survival Time**: 1000-2000 steps

Performance varies based on:
- Random spawner placement
- Enemy behavior randomness
- Action exploration during training

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pygame not displaying**: Ensure display is available (not running headless)
2. **CUDA errors**: Set `device='cpu'` in model creation if no GPU
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce `n_envs` or `buffer_size`

### Tips
- Start with shorter training runs to test configuration
- Use TensorBoard to monitor learning progress
- Adjust rewards if agent gets stuck in local optima
